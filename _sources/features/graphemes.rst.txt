Grapheme Cluster Segmentation
=============================

Akshars are grapheme clusters. We use Unicode ``\X`` segmentation to preserve
conjuncts and matra behavior.

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: python

   from akshar.segment import segment_akshars
   segment_akshars("मौसम")            # ['मौ', 'स', 'म']
   segment_akshars("च्छा", matras=True)  # ['च', '्', 'छ', 'ा']

Guidelines
----------

- Never split inside a conjunct unless you explicitly set ``matras=True``.
- For display/annotation, keep akshars intact.
- For transliteration experiments, split matras/halants only as needed.
