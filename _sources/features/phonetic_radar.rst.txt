Phonetic Matching Radar (Hinglish ↔ Hindi)
==========================================

Suggest likely Devanagari spellings for a Hinglish input with a light‑weight
phonetic scorer. This is useful when users type romanized Hindi and you want
to hint what they meant without maintaining a full dictionary.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

   from akshar.phonetic import phonetic_radar_hinglish_to_hindi

   phonetic_radar_hinglish_to_hindi("thand", top_k=3)
   # [('थंड', 0.91), ('ठंड', 0.88), ('थण्ड', 0.77)]

How it works
------------

- Generates a small set of Devanagari candidates using simple Hinglish rules
  (e.g., ``th → {थ, ठ}``, ``nd → {ंड, ण्ड}``), keeping variants compact.
- Compares the Hinglish input with each candidate’s ITRANS romanization using
  an edit distance that penalizes near‑phonetic substitutions less (``t↔ṭ``,
  ``d↔ḍ``, ``n↔ṇ`` etc.).
- Returns top matches with scores in ``[0, 1]`` (higher is closer).
